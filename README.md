# WindPACT
Files and documentation for WindPACT reference models.
The report for the models is [here](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/67667.pdf) [2].

Summary
-------
The WindPACT models were a set of reference wind turbine
models that were made as part of a scaling study in the 
early 2000s [1]. These models were implemented in FAST v7
and v8 so that researchers might use the models [2].

Directory Contents
------------------
The directory currently contains  
1. Excel design files that contain the original design 
calculations from the WindPACT study that were used to
calculate the FAST parameters,  
2. FAST v7 and v8 input files for the four reference 
models, and  
3. modal analysis results from Modes v2.22.
